What is my understanding goal for this 30 minutes? 

How much of what I*'ve learned can be applied to my "first wow song experience, every time factory"?

Finish Ch. 4 toward understanding code enough to write the data -> log -> journal code
	* Understand exercise 1.3 of Think Python, Ch. 4
	condition that enables me to understand this code in an outstanding way forever in the future
		What are all the "coding laws" and definitions related to this... what patterns are inheritantly available in this code?

			Tuple
			Array
			Constructor
			Initializer
			Overload

			Inheritance
			
	Understand this code
		Constructor - object is already created when this method is called... initializer, created then value initialized...
		self...

        """Moves the turtle foward by the given distance."""
        x, y = self.x, self.y # is this a tuple? 
        p1 = [x, y] # this is an array, not a tuple
        p2 = self.polar(x, y, dist, self.heading)
        self.x, self.y = p2

	* Difference between assigning a value to the property of an instance (self.blah = 32) vs. (blah = 32)

So it adds ".x" and ".y" attributes to the class... or directly to the instance when it's called? 
Does it create the polar method right here, or does the code construct it elsewhere? 
What trigonometry is required to create the flowers in Allen's example? 


		
How self really works

"it is easy to see where the self fits in. You don't actually write instance methods in Python; what you write is class methods which (must) take an instance as a first parameter. "

Why self is explicitly defined

		- Learned stack diagrams and docstrings
 - Understand p1 = [x, y] 
 - Understand tuples
 
To understand that I* don't understand 100 things, and not be fatigued by this, but inspired to understand more!!
