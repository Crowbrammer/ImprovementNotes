What are my best patterns?

The hourly focus. Knowledge leap. 

What are my worst patterns?

MB-ing. Oreos. Tensing up with Osu!. If I* lose, I* won't have fun. 

What different patterns could I* adopt--or what are patterns that I* don't have but should?

Feel relaxed at all times. Believe that I* have fun in winning and losing.

How could the good patterns become even better?
Now replay the experiences fully, but with the new patterns in place
